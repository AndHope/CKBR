 tradition_ghazi_name: "Ghazi"
 tradition_ghazi_desc: "Ghazi is an Arabic word in origin, derived from ghazā - "raided" or "waged war", that designates those Muslims who have sworn to fight non-believers in the Islamic religion. In pre-Islamic Bedouin culture, ghazw was a form of limited warfare verging on brigandage that avoided head-on confrontations and instead emphasized raiding and looting, usually of livestock. Following their conversion and the Early Muslim Conquests, Islamic ghāzīs regularly raided along the Byzantine frontier, finding in the Greek and Armenian akritoi their nemesis.\n\nBy the 9th century, the Arab raiding expeditions launched against Byzantium from the frontier zone had gradually assumed an almost ritual character and were strictly organized. According to  Qudama ibn Ja'far (a Syriac scholar and administrator for the Abbasid Caliphate), the conventional pattern of Arab incursions included a first expedition in spring, when horses could find abundant fodder, followed after about a month's rest by a summer raid, usually the main campaign of the year, and sometimes by a winter raid. The importance of these raids is summarized by Islamic scholar Hugh N. Kennedy: "the ṣāʿifa (summer raid) was as much a part of the symbolic and ritual functions of the Caliph as was organising and providing leadership for the annual hajj to Mecca"."

 tradition_barbary_corsairs_name: "Barbary Corsairs"
 tradition_barbary_corsairs_desc: "Though the practice of piracy and raiding had always plagued the Mediterranean, the coastal Berber states were able to vastly enrich themselves at the expense of their European neighbors. Such raids were such a thorn in the side of Italian, French, and Iberian rulers that the Sicilian Normans invaded North Africa in 1135, and in 1390, a French-Genoese joint military expedition embarked on the short-lived Barbary Crusade."
